## by Keely Silva-Glenn

## Description

This is a web app for Breads Bakery. It displays all store information including location, about, and products. It also provides a catering ordering portal where customers can log in and place catering orders. 

## Status

### Completed:
  * Users can view a list of all products, catering products, and general information about store
  * Users can log in or register in order to make an order
  * Users can place an order
  * Users can view all their orders
### Further Exploration:
  * The process for placing an order needs to be streamlined. I need to impliment parent/child view models or Ajax to allow user to flow from one page to the next while caring the ID of the order.
  * Need to add more styling to all pages
  * Need to impliment email confirmation to user
  * Need to impliment Stripe API to take actual credit cards
  * Need to create Admin role which can log in and view all orders
  * Need to create function to seperate orders based on department
  * Need to impliment different department roles who can see which products they need to make that day and for what time
